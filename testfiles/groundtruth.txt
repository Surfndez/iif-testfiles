in, with continual labour, he hath exercised the strength
and vigour of his Ingenuity or Invention. But I, perswa-
ded by the reasons of another nature, do verily believe, that
there is nothing more pernicious, nothing more de-
structive to the well-being of Men, or to the Salvation
of our Souls, than the Arts and Sciences themselves.
And therefore quite contrary to what has been hitherto

the Fucus's of Eloquence. For to speak Properly, not
Rhetorically, to intend the truth of the Matter, not
the ornament of Language, is the duty of one professing
Sacred Literature. For the Seat of Truth is not in the
Tongue, but in the Heart. Neither is it of importance,
